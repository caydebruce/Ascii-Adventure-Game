# Ascii Adventure
ascii rpg game

This program is a simple ascii art adventure game playble through the terminal on your computer!

To run this program just download the files from my github and use the .exe file to run the game from anywhere on your computer

The purpose of this project was just to familiarize myself with ascii art games. It is also the very first "video game" I've ever created!
