# Ascii Adventure
ascii rpg game

This program is a simple ascii art adventure game playble through the terminal on your computer!

To run this program make sure you have python3 installed on your device (Windows or Mac!) and then just navagate to the directory that contains the "mortalwounds.py" file and run "python3 mortalwounds.py"

The purpose of this project was just to familiarize myself with ascii art games. It is also the very first "video game" I've ever created!
